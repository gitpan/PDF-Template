   - determine image type from file extension if it wasn't passed in (Mike Andreev)
   - Chg required version of pdflib  to 4.0 (necessary for PDF_setcolor)
   - Added <circle> object (thanks Andy Thaller)   
   - bug fix for __FIRST__
   - Adding operators to conditional
   - Adding all sorts of image justification stuff (not sure it works yet though)
   - Adding image border
   - Added unicode support (not tested yet)
   - Adding support for external fonts
   - bug fix for images rendering when they shouldn't
   - Added image test
   - Added conditional test
   - Added font test
     The font test uses impact.ttf.  I grabbed this off of a website, it is probably
     not legal for me to include it.  I'll find a free truetype font soon to replace
     it with.     
   - Fixed bug with <page-break> that wasn't in a loop
   - Fixed bug with multiple top level <loop>
