PDF::Template is a layout system that creates Adobe PDF files from the same
data structure used by HTML::Template.

Currently, the only renderer support is pdflib_pl, which is from PDFLib
(www.pdflib.com). There is a free version (PDFLib Lite), but that does not
handle Unicode. If you need CJK fonts, you will need to purchase the full
version of PDFLib from them.

I am developing a version of PDF::Template that will work with PDF::API2. There
is a version developed by Autrijus Tang on CPAN that will work with PDF::API2,
but I do not support it. The new version I'm developing with merge the two
distributions, replacing his and mine and a new PDF::Template.
