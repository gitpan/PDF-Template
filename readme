Version 0.01 is ALPHA.  Certain things need improvement:

 * Documentation
 * Semantics of current Y position
 * Examples / Test Cases
 
This module requires pdflib be installed.  It will not work without it.

While I probably won't make huge changes to the XML spec,
there may be minor, non-backwards-compatible changes for
the next few revisions.
